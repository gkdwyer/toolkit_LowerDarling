# Could do those installs in another script
# Should we assume pyenv? or poetry, for that matter? I will for now.

## R
# pak should handle this in R_setup, but it's failing for some machines. I think pak only checks installed packages, but renv won't install without the C.
# I now do it in R_setup.R so it will be responsive to changes
